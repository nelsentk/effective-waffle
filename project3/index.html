<p>Taylor Swift is a singer/songwriter who started in Country and has since ended up in the Pop genre. She is known for her ability to make her songs relatable to her fanbase. In an article by Taylor Hodgkins, Swift stated that her "Habit inspires her in choosing something that is a phrase people often use in conversation, that kind of rhythmic cadence." Which she then uses in her song writing processes. Her use of storytelling in her songs continues to draw listeners back again and again. The range of different pieces on each of her albums is what makes them enjoyable to listen to all the way through. On her most recent album, the song "gold rush" is fun and upbeat about meeting someone and enjoying being with them. The track "majorie" is a slow melody that makes the listener reminisce about the times they had with their grandmother.  'Swifties' and casual listeners know there are hardly any gaps left once Swift finishes a song. Swift often fills those gaps with specially curated easter eggs, a process for which she has become well-known. This mix of sad, sweet, euphoric, and jubilant is why listeners of all ages continue to come back to listen. HODGKINS, T. (2020, December 21). An Inside Look Into Taylor Swift's Songwriting Process.
