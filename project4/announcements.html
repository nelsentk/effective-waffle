    <h3>DC PHASE 2 UPDATE</h3>
      <h5>July 7, 2020</h5>
      <p>Currently, we are open Tuesdays-Fridays 11-7, Saturdays 11-6 and Sundays from 11-5. We are doing curbside, virtual, shipping and in person shopping. No appointments necessary now, just walk on in (we do monitor the amount of customers in the shop so don’t worry). Masks are required. No mask, no entry.</p>

    <h3>COVID19: MARCH 16 UPDATE</h3>
      <h5>March 16, 2020</h5>
      <p>Starting Tuesday, March 17, we will start operating on Sunday hours (11-5). You can come in and shop with us or call and purchase by phone for curbside pick up. We still ask that if you have symptoms, are sick or think you may have been exposed that you refrain from shopping in store with us. We will not be doing private lessons, classes or anything that does not allow staff to keep a safe social distance. On the topic of social distance, we will not be allowing customers to come in and hang out to knit per usual. This was a very hard decision for us to make, but it just doesn’t stay within the guidelines of social distancing. It stinks, because this is such a big part of our shop environment. As soon as things settle down, you will of course be able to come in and relax with us per usual. Staff will also limit the number of customers in the shop at one time.
Customer special orders: If you have already been called that your order is in, you can come pick up per usual. As of today, we will be holding on all new special orders. We just don’t know what is going to be happening with our vendors at this point and we don’t want to guarantee any orders at this time.
Want to contribute, but don’t need any supplies right now? You can always call and buy a gift card for pick up next time you’re in or we can mail to you. We did start getting summer yarns last week so you can be ready for those warmer weather projects.
This is a day to day process for us right now. We hope to stay open as long as safely possible to serve you all. As changes do happen, we will post here and on our social media. Stay healthy everyone and knit/crochet your hearts out now!</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>

    <h3>COVID19</h3>
      <h5>March 15, 2020</h5>
      <p>So far, we plan to keep normal business hours. That said, our staff is like a little family. If you have fever or think you could potentially put others at risk, we ask that you do not shop with us in store at this time. As always, you can always call us and we can mail items to you.
Also, please understand that our staff have the right to refuse private lessons, cancel classes and deal with any situation that makes them uncomfortable. They’ve also been give the option to not work shifts. Please treat them with the same care you would show your family—they are vital to our community.
With that said, take this time to cast on every project your heart desires! This is the time to take care of you. We hope to be here and serve you during this tricky time. Our customers mean the world to us and we wouldn’t be here without you! If anything changes moving forward we will post again here and on our social media.</p>

    <h3>LYKKE NEEDLES</h3>
      <h5>February 27, 2020</h5>
      <p>We now carry the full line of Lykke needles! These circulars are super popular right now. We do have the interchangeable sets on order, but they have been backordered for a while due to popularity. We will post on social media once we receive those. In the meantime, come buy a pair of circulars for your next project and see what all the rage is about.</p>
